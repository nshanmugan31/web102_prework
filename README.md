Submitted by: Nishalini Shanmugan

Sea Monster App is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Answer: 
I would add a form to the website where vistors can submit funding for the unfunded games. I would also display what games need more funding out of the unfunded games.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Figuring out challenge 2 and 3 was harder for me because it took me a second to get the flow of this assignment. Get the stats working correctly was also challenging. But I think it was a good thing that this assignment was split up to many small challenges and you needed to complete one challenge to move to the next. I felt more confident that I was doing the right thing when I went to the next challenge because it showed the correct output for the website.
